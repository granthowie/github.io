I've gained experience working in startups and corporates around the world (Sydney, San Francisco, London and the Middle East). I am passionate about the role digital technology can play in disrupting existing, or creating entirely new, business models.

My experience has taught me to:

* Obsess about the customer: observe, ask questions, have empathy, test, measure

* Leverage technology and data to converge the digital/physical experience to help re-imagine the entire customer experience

* Empower cross-functional teams, with clear problems to solve, and let them run at it with speed and agility

* Connect with an ecosystem of people, technologies, startups and ideas outside your organisation/industry to identify threats, opportunities and partnerships

* and finally, Get Shit Done. Ideas alone do not create change.
